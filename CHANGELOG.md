# Changelog

Every change to NexusTomorrow that a player or a server operator would notice, newest first. The
format follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and each release is
named for its date. **Unreleased** is what `dev` holds that `main` doesn't yet.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The protocol reference has a page for the gateway's opcode table and one for the admin commands,
  both generated from the code.
- More of the client's messages carry their real names and field meanings: mail, quests, the
  inventory, groups, housing, guilds and logout, plus the realm-scoped id that characters and
  residences go by and chat's channel key.

### Changed

- Work lands on `dev`, now the default branch, and `main` holds what has been seen working with the
  client. Every Tuesday, `main` takes the newest `dev` that has been proven.
- The World messages are grouped by the client's feature areas, in the code and in the protocol
  reference. Messages no area claims yet sit under Unsettled.
- A reference page the generator no longer writes keeps a tombstone that says so, instead of going
  stale.

### Fixed

- After logging in, the client no longer keeps reconnecting: the server answers its verified-address
  request.
- ClientConnector finds the client and `config.json` beside itself, whatever folder it is started
  from.
- A test run filtered to some tests no longer fails on the test projects the filter leaves empty,
  and one whose filter matches nothing now fails.
